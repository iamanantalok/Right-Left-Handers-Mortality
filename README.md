# Analyzing the Age at Death Difference between Right-Handers and Left-Handers

## Introduction
### 1.1 About the Project
Welcome to the repository for our data-driven analysis of the age at death difference between right-handers and left-handers. This project aims to unravel the intriguing relationship between handedness and longevity using data from a 1986 National Geographic survey and 1999 United States death distribution data.

### 1.2 Objectives and Deliverables
The primary objectives of this project are to explore trends in left-handedness over time, calculate conditional probabilities of age at death based on handedness, and examine the distributions of conditional probabilities. We'll also compare these findings with previous research and offer insights into the complex interplay of handedness, societal shifts, and age-related factors that contribute to variations in the average ages at death.

We have uncovered a significant age gap between left-handed and right-handed individuals, largely attributed to the changing rates of left-handedness in the population. Our analysis provides reassuring news for left-handers â€“ your handedness is unlikely to significantly impact your lifespan.

The reported rates of left-handedness have increased over the years, showing a shift in societal attitudes. This transformation results in more elderly right-handers, impacting the age gap between the two groups.

While our results may slightly differ from previous studies due to data variations, we have provided insights into the causes of such discrepancies and avenues for further research. We invite you to explore the intricacies of our analysis and delve into the fascinating intersection of handedness and age at death.

This project represents the beginning of a journey. The firm plans to continually update the data, integrate it with their systems, and draw further insights, highlighting the ever-evolving nature of human traits and the complex factors that shape them over time..
